# GamingBoards 2.2.0
[Preview](https://gaming-boards-theme.proboards.com/)

*GamingBoards* is a deep blue and light gray theme with bright blue accents, built on commission for use with the free forum software [ProBoards](https://proboards.com/). It features many custom features, such as a togglable sidebar, dark mode, and remodels for all major layout templates. This theme is also completely responsive, which is not inherently supported in the current version of ProBoards. Developed using my v5 theme base, [*cast*](https://github.com/elli-mccale/pbt-cast).
